Buttons
-

Buttons are useful for making links stand out, for example, a download or read more button.

Here is an example regular (gray) button:

    <button>Button text here</button>
    
Say we want to get fancy and add a little blue to it:

    <button class="btn-confirm">Oooh! A pretty blue button!</button>
    
This is good for a sorta-non-important confirmation button.
