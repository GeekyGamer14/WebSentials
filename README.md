Buttons
-

Buttons are useful for making links stand out, for example, a download or read more button.

Here is an example regular (gray) button:

    <button>Button text here</button>
    
Say we want to get fancy and add a little blue to it:

    <button class="btn-confirm">Oooh! A pretty blue button!</button>
    
This is good for a sorta-non-important confirmation button.

To make any button larger than usual, to grab attention, just add the `btn-big` class to any button.

Example:

    <!-- Big confirm button -->
    <button class="btn-confirm btn-big">Here is a big confirm button</button>
    
    <!--Big regular button -->
    <button class="btn-big">Big button!</button>
